**Abstract:**  
Climate change intensifies the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations such as low-income families, rural communities, the elderly, and marginalized groups. This project integrates climate and socioeconomic data to identify the top 50 U.S. counties most vulnerable to climate-related disasters, providing data-driven insights for policymakers to allocate resources effectively.

### Key Components

- **Data Sources and Processing**:  
  We analyzed multiple datasets to capture climate risks and economic vulnerability:

  - **5th National Climate Assessment (NCA5)**: Provided climate projections and environmental impact data.
  - **Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)**: Highlighted economic vulnerability and public health preparedness.
  - **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)**: Supplied local area unemployment statistics.
  - **U.S. Census Bureau (SAIPE)**: Delivered small-area income and poverty estimates.

  Data cleaning involved addressing missing values, encoding issues, and removing rows with incomplete county information to prepare a high-quality dataset.

- **Methodology**:  
  A scoring system was implemented to rank counties based on risk factors:

  - **Preliminary Approach**: Ranked counties using raw variable values but found this method failed to capture variable interactions.
  - **Revised Approach**:
    - Constructed a correlation matrix to evaluate variable relationships.
    - Developed a weighted scoring system assigning higher importance to critical factors.
    - Applied MinMaxScaler in Python to normalize scores between 0â€“10.

- **Visualization and Dashboard**:  
  A **SAS-based interactive dashboard** demonstrates the analysis results, providing clear visualizations of county-level risk scores.

### Results and Policy Recommendations

- **Findings**:  
  The project identified the top 50 vulnerable counties, with key insights into their risk profiles:

  - Example: **Phillips County, AR** (Score: 5.79/10) exhibited high heat extremes and poverty rates.
  - **Barbour County, WV** (Score: 4.17/10) showed significant flood risks and poverty rates.

- **Recommendations**:  
  To mitigate risks and support affected communities, the following policies are proposed:
  - **Invest in Resilient Infrastructure**: Strengthen flood defenses and heat-resistant buildings.
  - **Economic Support Programs**: Offer job training and financial relief in vulnerable counties.
  - **Healthcare and Disaster Response**: Improve healthcare facilities and emergency systems for climate-related crises.

### Conclusion

The project demonstrates how integrating climate and socioeconomic data can provide actionable insights to address the compounded challenges of climate change and economic vulnerability.
