I'm Jaewon Cho, studying Computer Engineering at Purdue University and expecting to graduate in December 2025. I am interested in Data Science and am currently an undergraduate research assistant with the SAS ORSOL team, working on analyzing electric vehicle charging demand using synthetic data. This role has deepened my skills in data modeling and large-scale analysis.

I also completed a software engineering internship at Samsung Electronics, where I developed backend systems and managed databases. These hands-on projects, along with my research experience, reflect my passion for data engineering, machine learning, and applying technology to solve real-world challenges across industry sectors.

During my time, I enjoy playing basketball and listening to music, which helps me stay creative and balanced.
