<!-- I’m Jaewon Cho, currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering at Purdue University, set to graduate in May 2025. I have a strong interest in Data Science and currently serve as an undergraduate researcher with the SAS ORSOL team, working on analyzing electric vehicle charging demand using synthetic data. This experience has deepened my understanding of predictive modeling and large-scale data analysis.

I also completed a software engineering internship at Samsung Electronics, where I developed backend systems and managed databases. These hands-on projects, along with my research experience, reflect my passion for data engineering, machine learning, and applying technology to solve real-world challenges across industry sectors.

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and listening to music, which help me stay creative and balanced. -->
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
