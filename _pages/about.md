I’m Jaewon Cho, currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering at Purdue University, set to graduate in May 2025. I have a strong interest in Data Science and currently serve as an undergraduate researcher with the SAS ORSOL team, working on analyzing electric vehicle charging demand using synthetic data. This experience has deepened my understanding of predictive modeling and large-scale data analysis.

I also completed a software engineering internship at Samsung Electronics, where I developed backend systems and managed databases. These hands-on projects, along with my research experience, reflect my passion for data engineering, machine learning, and applying technology to solve real-world challenges across industry sectors.

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and listening to music, which help me stay creative and balanced.
